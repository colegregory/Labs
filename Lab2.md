2\. Choosing a license lets you, as the creator of a project, 
determine how people can contribute to the project and what the future of the project will be.
Since there are many different types of license, it is important to look at the ones that meet your needs. 
For example, if you think the best way to get people to contribute to your project is by having no restrictions, 
a permissive license. This also lets people know about the project ahead of time before they decide to contribute.

3\. You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because it could be proprietary. The default 
for any project is all rights reserved so it is better to avoid any chance of copyright infringement.
