2\. Choosing a license lets you, as the creator of a project, 
determine how people can contribute to the project and what the future of the project will be.
Since there are many different types of license, it is important to look at the ones that meet your needs. 
For example, if you think the best way to get people to contribute to your project is by having no restrictions, 
a permissive license. This also lets people know about the project ahead of time before they decide to contribute.

3\. You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because it could be proprietary. The default 
for any project is all rights reserved so it is better to avoid any chance of copyright infringement. 

4\. I agree that a reason Gopher lost to the Web was its failure to adopt an open systems approach. Opening up Web technology to a wider community allowed it to grow and advance much faster than Gopher. Gopher's decision to not involve its community prevented it from improving as quickly as the Web and greatly contribtued to its failure. 

5\. Microsoft chose to use an MIT license because they want to make it as easy as possible for developers to make new applications. The market for developer tools is relatively small compared to the market for their main products like Windows or Windows Phones. The more apps that are available for these platforms, the more people will consider purchasing them. 

6\. An example of an open source project could be a CSS animation library. A good license for this project would be the LGPL license. This license is often used for libraries because it ensures any future modifications are covered under the LGPL license. This adds new developments back to the library and makes sure the library remains accessible. Applications that use the library don't have to be covered by the license, so users are further inclined to include the library in their projects. 

7\. The GPL license would be the best for a developer because it makes sure all modfications are made public. One of a developer's main goals is to improve their software, and by having access to all modifications, improvements could be made much faster. For a company, the LGPL license might be a better choice. A company might focus more on creating a userbase than just improving software. Because the LGPL license doesn't require applications using its software to be licensed under LGPL, more people would have incentive to use the software in their projects. The Apache/BSD license would be the best for the common good because it gives the most freedom to users. The content is completely available to the public, so the most people can benefit from it.
