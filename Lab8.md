In the FreeBSD FAQ, Chapter 13: Security, I fixed a minor typo.

Changed:
```
The process is be able to run inside the walls.
Since nothing the process does in regards to executing code is supposed to be able to breech the walls...
```
To:
```
The process is only able to run inside the walls. 
Since nothing the process does in regards to executing code is supposed to be able to breach the walls...
```

Although this was a minor change, I learned how to submit a patch to FreeBSD. The process was pretty easy to understand and I would feel comfortable
contributing a more advanced patch in the future.

Maintaining good documentation is extremely important because it shows users what code does and how it is supposed to work. Poor documentation
can leave a reader confused about how code works, or in the worst case, it could give someone wrong information that leads to an error.
